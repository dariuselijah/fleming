## How to Cover Everything

### Strategy 1: Retry Failed Topics
Many topics failed due to rate limits. With the improved rate limiting, retry them:

```bash
# Retry all failed topics
npm run ingest:scale -- --retry-failed --workers 5
```

### Strategy 2: Process by Priority
Focus on high-impact topics first:

1. **Primary Care Essentials** (most common conditions)
   - Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia
   - Depression, anxiety
   - Preventive care

2. **High-Volume Specialties**
   - Cardiovascular (heart disease is #1 cause of death)
   - Oncology (cancer screening and treatment)
   - Infectious disease (COVID-19, sepsis, UTIs)

3. **Evidence-Rich Topics**
   - Topics with many RCTs and systematic reviews
   - Use `--high-evidence` flag to filter

### Strategy 3: Batch Processing
Process topics in batches by specialty:

```bash
# Cardiovascular batch
npm run ingest:scale -- --topics-file cardiovascular-topics.txt --workers 5

# Metabolic batch
npm run ingest:scale -- --topics-file metabolic-topics.txt --workers 5
```

### Strategy 4: Use Checkpoint System
The checkpoint system allows you to:
- Resume from any point
- Skip completed topics
- Retry failed topics
- Track progress

```bash
# Resume from checkpoint
npm run ingest:scale -- --resume --workers 5
```

### Strategy 5: Optimize Settings
For comprehensive coverage:

```bash
# High-quality, evidence-based ingestion
npm run ingest:scale \
  --high-evidence \
  --from-year 2015 \
  --max-articles 500 \
  --workers 5 \
  --ncbi-key YOUR_KEY
```

### Strategy 6: Monitor and Adjust
1. Check checkpoint file regularly
2. Identify patterns in failures
3. Adjust batch sizes and parallelism
4. Use NCBI API key for higher rate limits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Retry failed topics** - Many failed due to rate limits, now fixed
2. **Start with high-priority topics** - Primary care essentials
3. **Use NCBI API key** - Increases rate limit from 3/sec to 10/sec
4. **Process in batches** - By specialty to manage load

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Complete all 265 topics** - Full medical coverage
2. **Regular updates** - Re-ingest with new articles quarterly
3. **Quality over quantity** - Use high-evidence filter for critical topics
4. **Monitor coverage gaps** - Track which specialties need more topics

## Coverage Goals

- **Short-term**: Complete top 50 high-priority topics (primary care + common conditions)
- **Medium-term**: Complete all 265 topics (full specialty coverage)
- **Long-term**: Maintain and update with new research quarterly

## Next Steps

1. Review failed topics and retry with improved rate limiting
2. Prioritize topics by clinical importance
3. Set up automated ingestion pipeline
4. Monitor progress and adjust strategy
